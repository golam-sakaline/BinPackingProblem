# BinPackingProblem
Given a set of  𝑛  items with weight  𝑤𝑖  for item  𝑖=0,…,𝑛−1 , and an unlimited number of bins with identical capacities  𝑐  (all parameters are positive integers), assign each item to one bin so that the total weight of the items in each bin does not exceed  𝑐  and the number of bins used is a minimum.

Bin Packing can play an important role in optimizing last mile delivery in supply chain.

The Bin packing problem with time dependent cost is NP-hard. It can be trivially shown that the
bin packing problem (which is a well-known NP-hard problem) is a special case of this problem.
The piecewise time-dependent structure of the objective function greatly increases the complexity
of this difficult combinatorial optimization model. To efficiently solve the problem, we propose to
extend the well-known First Fit Decreasing (FFD), First Fit (FF), and Next Fit (NF) heuristics
methods to compare the optimum bin packing strategy. First Fit Decreasing (FFD), First Fit (FF)
and Next Fit algorithms are used to compare their performance in terms of least number of required
bins
